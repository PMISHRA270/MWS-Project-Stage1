# MWS-Project-Stage1
Mobile web specialist nanodegree - Restaurant Reviews App Stage 1

# About the Project
The original project upon which we have worked our solution can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1).

For the Restaurant Reviews projects, we will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In Stage One, we will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. We will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for our users.

# What do I do from here?
Clone/Download this repository and establish a http server. It can be done either by a chrome extension or python. I used [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en ) chrome extension to enable my http server.

Once your server is up and running, navigate to 
http://localhost:8000
in your browser to see the project in action.
